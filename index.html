<h1>Arthur T."E".P.</h1>

<h2><em>(Aspiring) Master <strike>Chef</strike> Web Developer</em></h2>
<h3><u>About</u></h3>
<p>A young man, who was a shut-in for 9 years. It has been written as 10, 11, and 12 before. "I counted this time! Trust me!!"
He is attempting to make his debut and find work, sponsors, scholarships, and friends to help him on his quest.
He has 1 life and high hit points. Please don't hit him. His mom would be mad and sad.
He doesn't know how to swim, fly, bike, or skate.
He knows how to be an idiot.
He prides himself in that and relishes it like a deluded maniac.
He doesn't swear and is rated G by the MPAA (not fact-checked).
He doesn't make promises, and is a tryhard at keeping his word.
How long am I going to have to write good things about him?
"Did you just call me an idiot and deluded maniac?"
He's a brilliant genius and the most realistic and normal person ever.
Personally, I find it difficult to trust someone who can't count past 9 and tells me to trust them.
"I did not have you write about me to be humilated."</p>
